# End-to-End-Machine-Learning
The first project in the book Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow.

This Article contains the steps followed in the End-to-End Machinelearning project in the Hands-on machine learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow book. The modal shold learn from the given data and be able to predict the median housing price in given district (here a district is considered as the group of 600 to 3000 people).The project was to duild a modal to build a modal to detemine housing prises in the California region using the data California census data.The atributes of data are population ,median_income median_housing_value, total_rooms, housing_median_age, households, total_bedrooms, langitude and latitude. And a districts are taken as an instances.

when solving this kind of problem first we need to understand why are we doing this,(*What is the business objective of this modal ..?*) as an example is this the whole project or a small part of it (the disision from this will be fed to another algorithem with other signals). Then we can deside the traning modal to be used in the problem.

Befroe traning the modal using the given data there are processes that needs to be carried out on the data to clean the data for much accurate reuslts, here are processes that carried out on the data set to clean the data.
